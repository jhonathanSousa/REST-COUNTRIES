# Rest Countries

My inspiration for building this project came from the Rest Countries Challenge at Frontend Mentor. Having only the proposed projects available, my goal was to build this project, making it fully responsive and practice using the Rest countries API.

## 🚀 Technologies :

**Front-end:** HTML5, CSS3 and JAVASCRIPT;

## 👩‍💻 Functionalities:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage;
- Search for a country using an input field;
- Filter countries by region;
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode
